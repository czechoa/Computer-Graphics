These are my programs for computer graphics in my third year of college.

Both programs written in Python, using numpy vectoring for optimization.


3-Camera
==================

The first program is a 3-camera ditching between solids. To solve the problem of obfuscation, I first sort the walls by Z-coordinates and then check which wall is in front of which behind. Then I display them according to the assumption of the painting algorithm.

Phong's algorithm.
==================

Illumination of the reflection of light from the sphere depends on the sphere's parameters and the intensity of light and angle of incidence.
