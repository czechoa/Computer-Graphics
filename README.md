These are my programs for computer graphics in my third year of college.

Both programs written in Python, using numpy vectoring for optimization.


3-Camera
==================

TThe first program is a 3d camera moving between solids. To solve the obstruction problem I used the painting algorithm. First I sort the walls according to Z coordinates, then based on the plane equation I check which should be displayed first and which last.

Phong's algorithm.
==================

The second program displays the reflection of light from the sphere depends on the parameters of the sphere and the intensity of the light and the angle of incidence.
